# timetable
scheduler timetable (exams, classes, events, ..)

🎨 Inspired by Grible's timetable.js, but extended with new features like:

🔍 Details of each event (e.g., description, actor).

⚙️ Actions for events (e.g., edit, delete, view).

🔗 Overlapping events are handled properly (not messy if two events happen at the same time).
